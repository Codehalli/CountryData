Purpose for this program will be reading in a tab delimited file. In the file there will be a list  
of countries around the earth. The program will read the file and facts about each country.
Based on the input command it will output the country and the facts the country. 

Key Concepts in this program I used was being able to read from mulitple files and getting the proper information from the differenct countries, and the ability for the code to match the correct files and display it in a table format.
